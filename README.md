# Josephus_C-
This is the Josephus problem done in c++. The user runs the program through the terminal with command make then prog7 to start. The program asks for a name file with the names of the contestants in the game, then it reads them and gets rid of one at a time before we have a last man standing.

//Most of the code I wrote is contained in the Main.cpp file.
